# Basics Pytorch

In this basic functionalities of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) will be explored for small datasets. The goal is to work on how to load images, pre-process the images and perform data augmentation. Finally, a deep neural network will be trained to perform image classification.

 In this, the data will be loaded in two different way. At first, the `torchvision.datasets` subclasses will be used to load a dataset. Second, we will write are own dataset loader that performs the same activity. In the second case, the data and labels will be loaded from the hard-drive.
